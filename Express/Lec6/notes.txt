--> Get vs Post

-> Get: This should be used to fetch/retrive the data.
Can we send data using GET :- Yes but we dont do this
  Because: Here the data is available inside our url as Query Parameter (?) means less secure
  data sent using get that will be a plain string & only available as QP
  limited amount of data can be sent 4096 bytes of data

-> Post : This should be used to make the changes in the server(DB)
Here the data is available as req.body
More Secure (as data not available in url)
data of different type can be sent ex. text, XML, JSON, etc.
Huge huge amount of data can be sent by post.
