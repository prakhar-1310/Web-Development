--> Static files in Express
.html, .css, .js, .jpg, folder(inside this images .jpg, .png)


--> we can change our 'views' folder name but we should not do so as it is convention

-> we store all my static files in one folder named 'public'. it is not compulsory its a convention

--> In views folder we can have many ejs file and we have to always write html header and footer in every ejs file
  So, to save us from this repetitive tasks we use to divide html in two parts header & footer And we save these two files in 'partials' folder in 'views' folder 
  -> partial contains repeated code
