--> Templating -> one structure and use it when required
/cat -> 1 page
/dog -> 1 page
No -> it is impossible
1 route, 1 page
when page do not refress when we search anything that means req is ejs request
in ejs render model -> there is JS layer between server and browser(client)
when browser send req to server it searches in DB and return relevant result to the server, if page dont refress means data send to client is in the form of JS (data)
And with returned data page will render at client side without refressing the page





-> res.render(view)
to see a template we have to render
view -> its contain templates (show) (UI how it is looking)
to view we need -> templating engines (templating language)
work of templating engine : to show view or structure
types of templating engines:
1.hbs(handlebars)
2.ejs (embedded java script)   <- we use this
3.pug
4.jade
5.nunjucks


-> ejs 
it is a package, we have to require this
ejs is basically used for writing the js logic in html environment
npm i ejs
tags in ejs:
1. <%   %>  -> Scriptlet tag for control flow(loop, if else) (no output)
2. <%=  %>  -> Output the value into the template(evaluate)
3. <%#  %>  -> Commenting tag, no execution, no output
4. <%-  %>  -> Output the unescaped value into the template

Note: we will write least possible JS logic inside our ejs

-> complusion / routine :- always to use this:-> app.set("view engine", "ejs")
whatever will be ur template (1-1000) all these file will be inside a folder name 'views'
templating file will always be inside views folder and all file will be saved with extension '.ejs'
