DB:- collection of similar kind of data
Ex. list of programming language, list of IES

DATA:- collection of properties
useful data is known as information

information and data may vary as per requirement and need.

Everything is data , jo meri kaam ki h vo information

Q. What else we can use to store the data?
File System

Q. why we dont use file System?
Ans. DATA Redundancy (duplicacy, repetition)
Data ineficiency
Data inconsistency
Less Security (DB have 7 layer of security)
less Scalability
Limited data
Searching difficult



->Type of DATABASE
1. SQL(Structured Querry Language) -> Not a db its a query language
SQL: vo database jo output / result show krne ke liye SQL queries ka use karte h un DB ko sql database kehte h
Ex. My Sql, oracle
2. NO SQL: they dont use sql query to show result
Ex. MongoDB, dynamoDB



Q. What is DBMS?
Ans. Software which manages data
types 2:
1. RDBMS: Relational (jha pr table hote h) -> SQL
2. NRDBMS : Non Relational (jha pr table nhi hote) -> NoSQL


table:
primary key: uniqually identifies the table
foreign key: helps in connecting 2 tables
            PK of another table

------------------------------------------------------------------------


No SQL DB:-

how it is stored:- in the form of object (we dont have table in this)
{
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name" : "Samarth",
        "text" : "hi from samrth"
    },
    {...},
    {...}
}


Q. Which db to choose?
SQl / NoSQL

To choose DB we use 'CAP' Theorem:
1. Consistency: Same everywhere (dont loose its consistency) -> sql more consistent
2. Availability: ex. utube view (19-20 chalta h but available when required)-> non sql is better
3. Partition Tolerance: if same data is saved at different servers then changes should be reflected in both the servers -> sql and nosql they both are equally trained


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Mongo DB

Q. Why MongoDB?
Ans. used Widely (MERN, MEAN, MEVN in all these MongoDB is common)  
    Easy Syntax


Architecture: 2 types
1. Monolithic: 1DB
2. Micro-service: Multiple DB

// mysql -> strict schema
//mongodb -> dont have any predefind schema, every collection may have different schema




install MongoDB from MongoDB community
then install MongoDB shell

in cmd write-> mongosh to open MongoDB shell (also known as mongosh)
mongosh is also an repl
1+1 ->2
exit or ctrl+c -> to get exit from mongosh

show dbs;
or show dbs
or show databases -> all are same, used to see all db present

test-> default db of no use

use admin -> to switch db 'admin'

db -> tell us where we are currently working

db.dropDatabase() --> delete db where we currently working (dont use this command)

use newDB ->use command is also used to create new db

new db does not shown until it atleast one collection in it


Q. What is a Collection ?  (specific for MongoDB)
Ans. just like table present in sql db
large no. document makes a collection

Q. What is document?
Ans. Each atomic entity inside a Collection is a document.

Document -> DOM or DB

Document -> collections -->DB (NoSQL)

rows/column --> tables -> DB (SQL)

Q. How Data is being stored in the DB?
Ans. BSON (Binary JSON)

->Difference bet JSON & BSON
1. JSON is slower than BSON
2. JSON occupies more space
3. JSON supports less/basics datatypes
