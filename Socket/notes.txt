*** Socket.io

- library for real time communication
- it is a library of web Socket

web socket : it is a protocol (like https://, http://)


feature of socket:
1. real time communication means 
2. instantaneous, 
3. low latency
4. bidirectional
5. event based communication (means send button click , event triggered, data send)




traditional protocol : - ex. https://
in this client establish a connection with the server means 1 way
server never ask anything from the user until user not ask anything

in traditional protocol:
when client is establishing a connection with a server, then it passes through many layers(includes security layer)
and it is not fixed that all time the server (there are many server available so that load can be balanced) will be same to serve our request
So it takes time everytime when we request





Socket:
if user1 want to communicate with user2, then 
user1 will establish connection with communication server
and this server will establish connection with user2
means two way communication, bi-directional 

in this:
only first time client or server takes time to connect with server or client, one connection established
server will be fixed to serve our request
so this is instantaneous(low latency or real time)







Express server uses http protocol behind the scene
so we cannot use express to create socket
but we can use express for routing purpose

to create socket we use http servers
we wrap http server in socket protocol
Socket(http Server)

----------------------------------------

Socket.IO:
-it is composed of two parts:
1. which works on server side
2. which works on client side

npm i socket.io



client and server connected with each other known as pipeline
for every pipeline we have a unique socket.id
io has many socket connections, every socket connection is a pipeline and every pipeline has unique socket id
