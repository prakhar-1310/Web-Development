React is a single page application means it will not reload or refresh to render a new page
It can have multiple pages.

-> React router dom is a 3rd party library which prevent from reloading the page when we render a new page.
singup page -to-> login page ; 2 pages but no reloading
npm i react-router-dom

->To take advantages of react-router-dom:
we have to do following changes in index.js file.

import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
<BrowserRouter>
    App Component
</BrowserRouter>





-> React is client side rendering, and this is achieve by using react-router-dom

anchor tag redirect to the link and refreshes the page
but we dont want to refresh the page therefore we use Link tag(it do not refresses the page)
Link is present in react-router-dom

useNavigate is a function present in react-router-dom used to redirect 
Ex. let navigate = useNavigate();
    let redirectPagehandler=()=>{
      navigate('/');
    }
