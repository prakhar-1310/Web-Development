npx create-react-app .
. represents that file name will we same as folder name we are currently inside.
in fontend we will also install react-router-dom and axios
axios:-



---> useRef()-> ref for reference
when we want a reference to a value & there is no need of rerendering.
example: screenshot attached












--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****Backend:---------------
npm init-y
npm i express nodemon mongoose

in backend we will have: models, app.js, seed.js, api(not routes because routes is used to redirect or render and api is used to send data to frontend)


**CORS: cross origin resource sharing:
means for transporting data from backend to frontend or vice verca we have to transfer data from one port to another port
means ek server se dusre server ko request bhejna are not allowed
to do this we have to instal CORS
npm i cors

install this in backend
and take request from frontend (3000 port no.)
