--> NPM
npm is also like a cmd tool
from here we can easily install new packages
ex:
$ npm install --save give-me-a-joke
here $ shows that we have to rum thid file in terminal
--save is not important to write as it is for earlier versions of vs code
npm insatll give-me-a-joke
install -> i
npm i give-me-a-joke


Steps to make a project:
s1: make a folder
s2: cd .. folder name
s3: need to initialize a project and creates a package.json file
S4: npm init  --> means mai apne project ko npm ke through initialise kar rha hu
s5: work of package.json : project kis kis pr dependent h
                        : info of the project
s6: install the package
ex: $ npm install --save give-me-a-joke
when we install a package two new file is created : package-lock.json  &  node_modules
package-lock.json: installed package internally kis kis pr dependent h uska information
node_modules: source code of installed packages
these two files are huge large dont share these two files
node modules contains some sensitive info and by using these info one can hack ur package so dont share
s7: now make index.js file, and require downloaded packages and start ur work


install is of two type : 
1. local : available for the project where we have installed the package
npm i colors
2. global : available globally for all projects
npm i -g colors


we can also uninstall the package
npm uninstall colors
or npm u colors

rm -r node_modules                 -r stands for recursive remove
rm -r package-lock.json

rm -f file name               -f denoted forceful remove






-> to install all dependent file and package at once:
npm i
