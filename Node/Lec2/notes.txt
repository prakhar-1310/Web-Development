->path module 
directly use it 
path.join('sam','prakhar','hii','project')
'sam\\prakhar\\hii\\project'


->file system (fs): module present in node
in order to use these modules we dont need to install anything
work as dbms
used before dbms
in file system we can perform CRUD operations  (create, read, update, delete )
due to data redundancy in file system dbms came in picture
data redundancy->1.copy of data
        2. security
        3. unmatched/incorrect data



-> Requiring a file
multiple js file increases readability
without export no import



-> Requiring a folder
when we require a folder its mandatory to create index.js file
Because things exported by index.js file will be imported when we require a folder


-> for package.json 
npm init -y
make some changes so that we use import word instead of require
add -> "type": "module"
